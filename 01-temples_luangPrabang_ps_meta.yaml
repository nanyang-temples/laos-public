  ## Temples in Luang Prabang, Laos (2024)

  This nanyang data layer is excerpted from a larger collection of heritage buildings in Luang Prabang by Peter Simms in connection with UNESCO Heritage standards. While in the original data source geo-references each building, the Nanyang Data version one has one set of coordinates per site. The larger project is online at https://www.luangprabangculture.com/.
