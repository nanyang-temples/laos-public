projectName: Temples in Luang Prabang, Laos (2024)

description: |
  This nanyang data layer is excerpted from a larger collection of heritage buildings in Luang Prabang created by Peter Simms based on UNESCO Heritage standards. While the original data source geo-references each building (see 01-temples_luangPrabang_ps_source.kml ), the Nanyang Data version only references temple sites, not buildings. The larger project is online at https://www.luangprabangculture.com/.
