  This nanyang data layer is excerpted from a larger collection of heritage buildings in and around Luang Prabang created by Peter Simms based on UNESCO Heritage sites and his own fieldwork. The Nanyang Data version of the data only references temple sites, not buildings. The larger project is online at https://www.luangprabangculture.com/.
