  notes: Temple of the pond was built in 1740 by Nai Chao Hang. The pond had been
    considered the eye of the naga which created Mt Phou Si in the centre of Luang
    Prabang. The 211kg Buddha image was bought from Thailand by a rich merchant. The
    statue was planned to go to his town but the raft refused to travel beyond Ban
    Nong. The statue miraculously survived a large fire during New year festivities
    in1774 as well another fire in 1886. The current building dates to 1965 after
    severe storm damage.

  notes: The Temple of the Thornless Bamboo Forest was founded in 1861 by Phaya Si
    Mahanam. It was used as a private chapel by the king. Inside are rare nineteenth
    century murals depicting the humbling of King Jambupati by the Buddha and other
    scenes showing Luang Prabang as a heavenly city receiving Chinese, European and
    Persian visitors. Infamously, the French art historian Henri Parmentier in his
    L'art du Laos described these charming and interesting murals as ridiculous.
